 ;; Your patient is applying to the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for
 ;; disability benefits.  VA will consider the information you provide on this
 ;; questionnaire as part of their evaluation in processing the Veteran's claim.
 ;;
 ;; 1. Diagnosis
 ;; Does the Veteran now have or has he/she ever had a temporomandibular joint
 ;; condition?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, provide only diagnoses that pertain to temporomandibular joint
 ;; conditions:
 ;;
 ;; Diagnosis #1: _________________________
 ;; ICD code: _____________________________
 ;; Date of diagnosis: ____________________
 ;;
 ;; Diagnosis #2: _________________________
 ;; ICD code: _____________________________
 ;; Date of diagnosis: ____________________
 ;;
 ;; Diagnosis #3: _________________________
 ;; ICD code: _____________________________
 ;; Date of diagnosis: ____________________
 ;;
 ;; If there are additional diagnoses that pertain to temporomandibular
 ;; joint conditions, list using above format.
 ;;
 ;; 2. Medical History
 ;; a. Describe the history (including onset and course) of the Veteran's
 ;; temporomandibular joint condition (brief summary): __________________________
 ;; _____________________________________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 3. Flare-ups
 ;; Does the Veteran report that flare-ups impact the function of the
 ;; temporomandibular joint? 
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, document the Veteran's description of the impact of flare-ups on
 ;;
 ;; function in his or her own words: ___________________________________________
 ;;^TOF^
 ;; 4. Initial range of motion (ROM) measurements
 ;; Measure ROM. During the measurements, document the point at which painful
 ;; motion begins, evidenced by visible behavior such as facial expression,
 ;; wincing, etc. Report initial measurements below.
 ;;
 ;; Following the initial assessment of ROM, perform repetitive use testing. For
 ;; VA purposes, repetitive use testing must be included in all joint exams. The
 ;; VA has determined that 3 repetitions of ROM (at a minimum) can serve as a
 ;; representative test of the effect of repetitive use. After the initial
 ;; measurement, reassess ROM after 3 repetitions. Report post-test measurements
 ;; in section 5.
 ;;
 ;; a. ROM for lateral excursion
 ;;    ___ Greater than 4 mm
 ;;    ___ 0 to 4 mm
 ;;
 ;; Select where objective evidence of painful motion begins:
 ;;    ___ No objective evidence of painful motion
 ;;    ___ Greater than 4 mm
 ;;    ___ 0 to 4 mm
 ;;
 ;; b. ROM for opening mouth, measured by inter-incisal distance
 ;;    ___ Greater than 40 mm
 ;;    ___ 31 to 40 mm
 ;;    ___ 21 to 30 mm
 ;;    ___ 11 to 20 mm
 ;;    ___ 0 to 10 mm
 ;;
 ;; Select where objective evidence of painful motion begins:
 ;;    ___ No objective evidence of painful motion
 ;;    ___ Greater than 40 mm
 ;;    ___ 31 to 40 mm
 ;;    ___ 21 to 30 mm
 ;;    ___ 11 to 20 mm
 ;;    ___ 0 to 10 mm
 ;;
 ;; c. If ROM does not conform to the normal range of motion identified above but
 ;; is normal for this Veteran (for reasons other than a temporomandibular joint
 ;; condition, such as age, body habitus, neurologic disease), explain: _________
 ;; _____________________________________________________________________________
 ;;^TOF^
 ;; 5. ROM measurement after repetitive use testing
 ;; a. Is the Veteran able to perform repetitive-use testing with 3 repetitions?
 ;;    ___ Yes   ___ No    If unable, provide reason: ___________________________
 ;; If Veteran is unable to perform repetitive-use testing, skip to section 6.
 ;; If Veteran is able to perform repetitive-use testing, measure and report ROM
 ;; after a minimum of 3 repetitions.
 ;;
 ;; b. Post-test ROM for lateral excursion
 ;;    ___ 0 to 4 mm
 ;;    ___ Greater than 4 mm
 ;;
 ;; c. Post-test ROM for opening mouth, measured by Inter-incisal distance
 ;;    ___ Greater than 40 mm
 ;;    ___ 31 to 40 mm
 ;;    ___ 21 to 30 mm
 ;;    ___ 11 to 20 mm
 ;;    ___ 0 to 10 mm
 ;;
 ;; 6. Functional loss and additional limitation in ROM
 ;; The following section addresses reasons for functional loss, if present, and
 ;; additional loss of ROM after repetitive-use testing, if present. The VA defines
 ;; functional loss as the inability to perform normal working movements of the
 ;; body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination and/or endurance.
 ;;
 ;; a. Does the Veteran have additional limitation in ROM of either TMJ following
 ;; repetitive-use testing?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; b. Does the Veteran have any functional loss or functional impairment of
 ;; either TMJ?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; c. If the Veteran has functional loss, functional impairment and/or additional
 ;; limitation of ROM of either TMJ after repetitive use, indicate the contributing
 ;; factors of disability below (check all that apply and indicate side affected):
 ;;    ___ No functional loss for right TMJ
 ;;    ___ No functional loss for left TMJ
 ;;    ___ Less movement than normal            ___ Right  ___ Left  ___ Both
 ;;    ___ More movement than normal            ___ Right  ___ Left  ___ Both
 ;;    ___ Weakened movement                    ___ Right  ___ Left  ___ Both
 ;;    ___ Excess fatigability                  ___ Right  ___ Left  ___ Both
 ;;    ___ Incoordination, impaired ability to
 ;;        execute skilled movements smoothly   ___ Right  ___ Left  ___ Both
 ;;    ___ Pain on movement                     ___ Right  ___ Left  ___ Both
 ;;    ___ Swelling                             ___ Right  ___ Left  ___ Both
 ;;    ___ Deformity                            ___ Right  ___ Left  ___ Both
 ;;^TOF^
 ;; 7. Pain (pain on palpation) and crepitus
 ;; a. Does the Veteran have localized tenderness or pain on palpation of joints
 ;; or soft tissues of either TMJ?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, side affected:     ___ Right  ___ Left  ___ Both
 ;;
 ;; b. Does the Veteran have clicking or crepitation of joints or soft tissues of
 ;; either TMJ?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, side affected:     ___ Right  ___ Left  ___ Both
 ;;
 ;; 8. Other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs
 ;; and/or symptoms
 ;; a. Does the Veteran have any scars (surgical or otherwise) related to any
 ;; conditions or to the treatment of any conditions listed in the Diagnosis
 ;; section above?  
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, are any of the scars painful and/or unstable, or is the total area of
 ;; all related scars greater than 39 square cm (6 square inches)?
 ;;    ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;       If yes, also complete a Scars Questionnaire.
 ;;
 ;; b.  Does the Veteran have any other pertinent physical findings, complications,
 ;; conditions, signs and/or symptoms related to any conditions listed in the
 ;; Diagnosis section above?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, describe (brief summary): ___________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 9. Diagnostic testing
 ;; The diagnosis of degenerative arthritis (osteoarthritis) or traumatic arthritis
 ;; must be confirmed by imaging studies. Once such arthritis has been documented,
 ;; no further imaging studies are required by VA, even if arthritis has worsened. 
 ;;
 ;; a. Have imaging studies of the TMJ been performed and are the results
 ;; available?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, is degenerative or traumatic arthritis documented?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, side affected:     ___ Right  ___ Left  ___ Both
 ;;
 ;; b. Are there any other significant diagnostic test findings and/or results?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, side affected:     ___ Right  ___ Left  ___ Both
 ;; If yes, provide type of test or procedure, date and results (brief summary):
 ;; _____________________________________________________________________________

 ;; 10. Functional impact
 ;; Does the Veteran's temporomandibular joint condition impact his or her ability
 ;; to work?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, describe the impact of each of the Veteran's temporomandibular
 ;; conditions, providing one or more examples: _________________________________
