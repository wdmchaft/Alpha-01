 ;; 14. Remaining effective function of the extremities
 ;; Due to the Veteran's hip and/or thigh condition(s), is there functional
 ;; impairment of an extremity such that no effective function remains other
 ;; than that which would be equally well served by an amputation with
 ;; prosthesis? (Functions of the upper extremity include grasping,
