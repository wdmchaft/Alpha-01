 ;;
 ;; Your patient is applying to the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
 ;; for disability benefits.  VA will consider the information you provide on
 ;; this questionnaire as part of their evaluation in processing the Veteran's
 ;; claim.
 ;;
 ;; 1. Diagnosis
 ;;
 ;; Does the Veteran now have or has he/she ever had an ankle condition?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, provide only diagnoses that pertain to ankle condition(s):
 ;; Diagnosis #1: ___________________
 ;; ICD code:  ______________________
 ;; Date of diagnosis: ______________
 ;; Side affected: ___ Right   ___ Left   ___ Both
 ;; 
 ;; Diagnosis #2: ___________________
 ;; ICD code:  ______________________
 ;; Date of diagnosis: ______________
 ;; Side affected: ___ Right   ___ Left   ___ Both
 ;;
 ;; Diagnosis #3: ___________________
 ;; ICD code:  ______________________

 ;; Side affected: ___ Right   ___ Left   ___ Both
 ;;
 ;; If there are additional diagnoses pertaining to ankle conditions, list
 ;; using above format: ________________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 2. Medical history
 ;;
 ;; Describe the history (including onset and course) of the Veteran's ankle
 ;; condition (brief summary): _________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 3. Flare-ups
 ;;
 ;; Does the Veteran report that flare-ups impact the function of the ankle?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, document the Veteran's description of the impact of flare-ups in
 ;; his or her own words: ______________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 4. Initial range of motion (ROM) measurements:
 ;;
 ;; Measure ROM with a goniometer, rounding each measurement to the nearest 5
 ;; degrees. During the measurements, document the point at which painful
 ;; motion begins, evidenced by visible behavior such as facial expression,
 ;; wincing, etc. Report initial measurements below.
 ;;^TOF^
 ;; Following the initial assessment of ROM, perform repetitive use testing.
 ;; For VA purposes, repetitive use testing must be included in all joint
 ;; exams. The VA has determined that 3 repetitions of ROM (at a minimum) can
 ;; serve as a representative test of the effect of repetitive use. After the
 ;; initial measurement, reassess ROM after 3 repetitions. Report post-test
 ;; measurements in section 5.
