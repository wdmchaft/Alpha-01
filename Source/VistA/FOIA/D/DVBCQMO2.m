 ;; Your patient is applying to the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for
 ;; disability benefits.  VA will consider the information you provide on this 
 ;; questionnaire as part of their evaluation in processing the Veteran's claim.
 ;;
 ;; 1. Definitions
 ;; Aggravation of preexisting nonservice-connected disabilities.
 ;; A preexisting injury or disease will be considered to have been aggravated
 ;; by active military, naval, or air service, where there is an increase in
 ;; disability during such service, unless there is a specific finding that the
 ;; increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease.
 ;;
 ;; Aggravation of nonservice-connected disabilities. 
 ;; Any increase in severity of a nonservice-connected disease or injury that
 ;; is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury,
 ;; and not due to the natural progress of the nonservice-connected disease, will
 ;; be service connected.

 ;; 3. Medical opinion for direct service connection
 ;; Choose the statement that most closely approximates the etiology of the
 ;; claimed condition.  
 ;;
 ;; a. ___ The claimed condition was at least as likely as not (50 percent or 
 ;; greater probability) incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury,
 ;; event, or illness.  Provide rationale in section c.
 ;;
 ;; b. ___ The claimed condition was less likely than not (less than 50 percent
 ;; probability) incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event,
 ;; or illness.  Provide rationale in section c.

 ;; c. Rationale: _______________________________________________________________

 ;; greater probability) proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's
 ;; service connected condition.  Provide rationale in section c.

 ;; 6. Medical opinion for aggravation of a nonservice connected condition by a
 ;; service connected condition
 ;; a. Can you determine a baseline level of severity of (claimed condition/
 ;; diagnosis) based upon medical evidence available prior to aggravation or the
 ;; earliest medical evidence following aggravation by (service connected 
 ;; condition)?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If "Yes" to question 6a., answer the following:
 ;;   i. Describe the baseline level of severity of (claimed condition/
 ;;      diagnosis) based upon medical evidence available prior to aggravation
 ;;      or the earliest medical evidence following aggravation by (service 
 ;;      connected condition): 
 ;;      ________________________________________________________________________
 ;;      ________________________________________________________________________
 ;;^TOF^
 ;;  ii. Provide the date and nature of the medical evidence used to provide 
 ;;      the baseline: __________________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; iii. Is the current severity of the (claimed condition/diagnosis) greater
 ;;      than the baseline?
 ;;          ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;          If yes, was the Veteran's (claimed condition/diagnosis) at least as
 ;;          likely as not aggravated beyond its natural progression by (insert
 ;;          "service connected condition")?
 ;;
 ;;          ___ Yes (provide rationale in section b.)
 ;;          ___ No  (provide rationale in section b.)
 ;;
 ;; If "No" to question 6a., answer the following:
 ;;   i. Provide rationale as to why a baseline cannot be established (e.g.
 ;;      medical evidence is not sufficient to support a determination of a
 ;;      baseline level of severity): ___________________________________________
 ;;  ii. Regardless of an established baseline, was the Veteran's (claimed
 ;;      condition/diagnosis) at least as likely as not aggravated beyond its
 ;;      natural progression by (insert "service connected condition")?
 ;;          ___ Yes (provide rationale in section b.)
 ;;          ___ No  (provide rationale in section b.)
