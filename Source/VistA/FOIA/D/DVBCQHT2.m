 ;; Your patient is applying to the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs

 ;; provide on this questionnaire as part of their evaluation in processing
 ;; the Veteran's claim.
 ;;
 ;;
 ;; 1. Diagnosis 
 ;;
 ;; Does the Veteran now have or has he/she ever been diagnosed with
 ;; hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension based on the following
 ;; criteria:
 ;;
 ;;    NOTE 1: For VA disability rating purposes, the term hypertension means
 ;;    that the diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90mm or greater, and
 ;;    isolated systolic hypertension means that the systolic blood pressure is
 ;;    predominantly 160mm or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less
 ;;    than 90mm.
 ;;
 ;;    NOTE 2: For VA purposes, for the INITIAL diagnosis of hypertension or
 ;;    isolated systolic hypertension must be confirmed by readings taken 2 or
 ;;    more times on at least 3 different days. Blood pressure results may be
 ;;    obtained from existing medical records or through scheduled visits for
 ;;    blood pressure measurements.
 ;;
 ;; ___ Yes  ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, provide only diagnoses that pertain to hypertension:
 ;;
 ;; ___Hypertension            ICD code: __________  Date of diagnosis: _______
 ;; ___Isolated systolic hypertension
 ;;                            ICD code: ___________ Date of diagnosis: _______
 ;; ___Other, specify: 
 ;;    Other diagnosis #1: ____________________

 ;;    Date of diagnosis: _______________
 ;;
 ;;    Other diagnosis #2: ____________________

 ;;    Date of diagnosis: _______________
 ;;
 ;; If there are additional diagnoses that pertain to hypertension or isolated
 ;; systolic hypertension, list using above format: ____________________________

 ;; NOTE 3: ALSO complete appropriate questionnaires for hypertension-related
 ;; complications, if any (such as Kidney, if renal insufficiency attributable
 ;; to hypertension ).

 ;; known:
 ;;
