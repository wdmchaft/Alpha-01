 ;;
 ;; Your patient is applying to the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs
 ;; (VA) for disability benefits.  VA will use the information you provide on
 ;; this questionnaire to process the Veteran's claim.  
 ;;
 ;; 1. Diagnosis
 ;;
 ;; NOTE: IHD includes, but is not limited to, acute, subacute, and old
 ;; myocardial infarction; atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease including
 ;; coronary artery disease (including coronary spasm) and coronary bypass
 ;; surgery; and stable, unstable and Prinzmetal's angina. IHD does not include
 ;; hypertension or peripheral manifestations of arteriosclerosis such as
 ;; peripheral vascular disease or stroke, or any other condition that does not
 ;; qualify within the generally accepted medical definition of ischemic heart
 ;; disease.
 ;; IHD encompasses any atherosclerotic heart disease resulting in clinically
 ;; significant ischemia or requiring coronary revascularization.
 ;;
 ;; Does the Veteran have ischemic heart disease (IHD)?   ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; NOTE: Provide only diagnoses that pertain to IHD.
 ;; Diagnosis #1: _______________________
 ;; ICD code: ___________________________
 ;; Date of diagnosis #1: _______________
 ;;
 ;; Diagnosis #2: _______________________
 ;; ICD code: ___________________________
 ;; Date of diagnosis #2: _______________
 ;;
 ;; Diagnosis #3: _______________________
 ;; ICD code: ___________________________
 ;; Date of diagnosis #3: _______________
 ;;
 ;; If additional diagnoses that pertain to IHD, list using above format:
 ;; _____________________
 ;;^TOF^
 ;; 2. Medical history
 ;;
 ;; Does the Veteran's treatment plan include taking continuous medication for
 ;; the diagnosed condition?   ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;     List medications: _______________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; Is there a history of:
 ;;
 ;; Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)   ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;     Treatment facility/date:_________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; Myocardial infarction   ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;     Treatment facility/date:_________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; Coronary bypass surgery   ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;     Treatment facility/date:_________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; Heart transplant   ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;     Treatment facility/date:_________________________________________________
 ;;     If yes, is it as likely as not that the Veteran's heart transplant is
 ;;     due to IHD?   ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; Implanted cardiac pacemaker   ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;     Treatment facility/date:_________________________________________________
 ;;     If yes, is it as likely as not that the Veteran's pacemaker is due to
 ;;     IHD?   ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; Implanted automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD)
 ;;     ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;     Treatment facility/date: ________________________________________________
 ;;     If yes, is it as likely as not that the Veteran's AICD is due to IHD?
 ;;     ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; 3. Congestive heart failure (CHF)
 ;;
 ;; Does the Veteran have CHF?      ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; Is the Veteran's CHF chronic?   ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If the Veteran's CHF is not chronic, has the Veteran had more than one
 ;; episode of acute CHF in the past year?   ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; Treatment facility/date of most recent episode of CHF: _______________________
 ;;
 ;; ______________________________________________________________________________
 ;;^TOF^
 ;; 4. Cardiac functional assessment
 ;;
 ;; Has a diagnostic exercise test been conducted?   ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; a. If yes, provide level of METs the Veteran can perform as shown by the
 ;; most recent diagnostic exercise testing: _______________
 ;;
 ;; Date of most recent diagnostic exercise test:___________
 ;;
 ;; b. If exercise METs testing was not completed because it is not required as
 ;; part of Veteran's treatment plan, complete the following METs test based on
 ;; the Veteran's responses:
 ;;
 ;; Lowest level of activity at which the Veteran reports symptoms (check all
 ;; symptoms that apply)
 ;;
 ;; ___ dyspnea   ___ fatigue   ___ angina   ___ dizziness   ___ syncope
 ;;
 ;; ___ (1-3 METs)   This METs level has been found to be consistent with
 ;;                  activities such as eating, dressing, taking a shower,
 ;;                  slow walking (2 mph) for 1-2 blocks
 ;;
 ;; ___ (>3-5 METs)  This METs level has been found to be consistent with
 ;;                  activities such as light yard work (weeding), mowing lawn
 ;;                  (power mower), brisk walking (4 mph)
 ;;
 ;; ___ (>5-7 METs)  This METs level has been found to be consistent with
 ;;                  activities such as golfing (without cart), mowing lawn
 ;;                  (push mower), heavy yard work (digging)
 ;;
 ;; ___ (>7-10 METs) This METs level has been found to be consistent with
 ;;                  activities such as climbing stairs quickly, moderate
 ;;                  bicycling, sawing wood, jogging (6 mph)
 ;; ___ The Veteran denies experiencing above symptoms with any level of
 ;;     physical activity
 ;;^TOF^
 ;; 5. Diagnostic testing
 ;; 
 ;; Determination of cardiac hypertrophy/dilatation is required; the suggested
 ;; order of testing for cardiac hypertrophy/dilatation is EKG, then chest
 ;; x-ray (PA and lateral), then echocardiogram. Echocardiogram is only
 ;; necessary if the other two tests are negative. A limited echocardiogram, if
 ;; available, is appropriate to determine if cardiac hypertrophy/dilatation is
 ;; present by measuring only left ventricular dimension, wall thickness and
 ;; ejection fraction.
 ;;
 ;; Is there evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation?   
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; Diagnostic test (provide most recent test only):
 ;;
 ;; ___ EKG              Date of EKG: ______________
 ;; ___ Chest x-ray      Date of CXR: ______________
 ;; ___ Echocardiogram   Date of echocardiogram:_______________
 ;; ___ Other study (specify): ________    Date:_______________
 ;;
 ;; Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), if known: ______%
 ;;     Date of test: ________________
 ;;
 ;; If LVEF testing is not of record, but available medical information
 ;; sufficiently reflects the severity of the Veteran's cardiovascular condition,
 ;; LVEF testing is not required.
 ;;
 ;; 6. Functional impact 
 ;; Does the Veteran's ischemic heart disease impact his or her ability to work?    
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, describe impact, providing one or more examples: ____________________
 ;;
 ;; _____________________________________________________________________________
 ;;^TOF^
 ;; 7. Remarks, if any

 ;; Physician signature: ________________________________________ Date:__________

 ;; Physician printed name: _____________________________________ Phone:_________
 ;; 
 ;; Medical license #: __________________
 ;; 
 ;; Physician address: __________________________________________________________
 ;; 
 ;; NOTE: VA may request additional medical information, including additional
 ;; examinations if necessary to complete VA's review of the Veteran's 
 ;; application.
