 ;;
 ;; 13. Diagnostic Testing
 ;;
 ;; For VA purposes, exams for all heart conditions require a determination of
 ;; whether or not cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation is present. The
 ;; suggested order of testing for cardiac hypertrophy/dilatation is EKG, then
 ;; chest x-ray (PA and lateral), then echocardiogram. An echocardiogram to
 ;; determine heart size is only necessary if the other two tests are negative.
 ;;
 ;; For VA purposes, if LVEF testing is not of record, but available medical
 ;; information sufficiently reflects the severity of the Veteran's
 ;; cardiovascular condition, LVEF testing is not required.

 ;; a. Is there evidence of cardiac hypertrophy?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, indicate how this condition was documented:
 ;; ___ EKG   ___ Chest x-ray   ___ Echocardiogram

 ;;
 ;; b. Is there evidence of cardiac dilatation?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No

 ;; ___ Other test, specify: ___________________________________________________
 ;;     Date: ________________
 ;;     Result: ______________
 ;;
 ;; 14. METs Testing
 ;;
 ;; NOTE: For VA purposes, all heart exams require METs testing (either
 ;; exercise-based or interview-based) to determine the activity level at
 ;; which symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope
 ;; develop (except exams for supraventricular arrhythmias).
 ;;^TOF^
 ;; If a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done
 ;; for medical reasons (e.g chronic CHF or multiple episodes of acute CHF
 ;; within the past 12 months), or if exercise-based METs test was not
 ;; completed because it is not required as part of the Veteran's treatment
 ;; plan, or if exercise stress test results do not reflect Veteran's current
 ;; cardiac function, perform an interview-based METs test based on the
 ;; Veteran's responses to a cardiac activity questionnaire and provide the
 ;; results below.
 ;;
 ;; Indicate all testing completed; provide only most recent results which
 ;; reflect the Veterans current functional status(check all that apply):
 ;;
 ;; a. ___ Exercise stress test
 ;; Date of most recent exercise stress test: ________________
 ;; Results: ___________________________________________________________________
 ;; METs level the Veteran performed, if provided: ___________
 ;;
 ;; b. ___ Interview-based METs test
 ;; Date of interview-based METs test: ______________
 ;;
 ;; Symptoms during activity:
 ;; The METs level checked below reflects the lowest activity level at which
 ;; the Veteran reports any of the following symptoms (check all symptoms that
 ;; the Veteran reports at the indicated METs level of activity):
 ;; ___ Dyspnea   ___ Fatigue   ___ Angina   ___ Dizziness   ___ Syncope
 ;; ___ Other, describe: _______________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; Results:
 ;; METs level on most recent interview-based METs test:
 ;;   ___(1-3 METs)   This METs level has been found to be consistent with
 ;;                   activities such as eating, dressing, taking a shower, slow
 ;;                   walking (2 mph) for 1-2 blocks
 ;;   ___(>3-5 METs)  This METs level has been found to be consistent with
 ;;                   activities such as light yard work (weeding), mowing lawn
 ;;                   (power mower), brisk walking (4 mph)
 ;;   ___(>5-7 METs)  This METs level has been found to be consistent with
 ;;                   activities such as walking 1 flight of stairs, golfing
 ;;                   (without cart), mowing lawn (push mower), heavy yard work
 ;;                   (digging)
 ;;   ___(>7-10 METs) This METs level has been found to be consistent with
 ;;                   activities such as climbing stairs quickly, moderate
 ;;                   bicycling, sawing wood, jogging (6 mph)
 ;;   ___ The Veteran denies experiencing symptoms with any level of physical
 ;;       activity
 ;;
 ;; c. If the Veteran has had both an exercise stress test and an interview-
 ;; based METs test, indicate which results most accurately reflect the
 ;; Veteran's current cardiac functional level:
 ;;    ___ Exercise stress test   ___ Interview-based METs test   ___ N/A
 ;;^TOF^
 ;; d. Is the METs level limitation due solely to the heart condition(s)?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If no, estimate the percentage of the METs level limitation that is due
 ;; solely to the heart condition(s):
 ;; __ 0%  __ 10%  __ 20%  __ 30%  __ 40%  __ 50%  __ 60%  __ 70%
 ;; __ 80%  __ 90%
 ;; __ The limitation in METs level is due to multiple factors; it is not
 ;; possible to accurately estimate this percentage
 ;;
 ;; e. In addition to the heart condition(s), does the Veteran have other
 ;; non-cardiac medical conditions (such as musculoskeletal or pulmonary
 ;; conditions) limiting the METs level?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, identify each condition and describe how each non-cardiac medical
 ;; condition limits the Veteran's METs level:
 ;;    Other medical condition #1: ________ Effect on METs level: ______________
 ;;    Other medical condition #2: ________ Effect on METs level: ______________
 ;;    If there are additional medical conditions affecting METs level, list
 ;;    using above format: _____________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 15. Functional impact
 ;;
 ;; Does the Veteran's heart condition(s) impact his or her ability to work?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, describe impact of each of the Veteran's heart conditions,
 ;; providing one or more examples: ____________________________________________
 ;; 
 ;; 16. Remarks, if any:  ______________________________________________________
