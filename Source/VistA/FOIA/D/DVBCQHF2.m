 ;; Your patient is applying to the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for
 ;; disability benefits.  VA will consider the information you provide on this
 ;; questionnaire as part of their evaluation in processing the Veteran's claim.
 ;;
 ;; 1. Diagnosis
 ;; Does the Veteran now have or has he/she ever had a hand or finger condition?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, provide only diagnoses that pertain to hand conditions:
 ;; Diagnosis #1: ___________________
 ;; ICD code:  ______________________
 ;; Date of diagnosis: ______________
 ;; Side affected:  ___ Right   ___ Left   ___ Both
 ;;
 ;; Diagnosis #2: ___________________
 ;; ICD code:  ______________________
 ;; Date of diagnosis: ______________
 ;; Side affected:  ___ Right   ___ Left   ___ Both
 ;;
 ;; Diagnosis #3: ___________________
 ;; ICD code:  ______________________
 ;; Date of diagnosis: ______________
 ;; Side affected:  ___ Right   ___ Left   ___ Both
 ;;
 ;; If there are additional diagnoses that pertain to hand conditions, list
 ;; using above format: ________________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 2. Medical history
 ;; a. Describe the history (including onset and course) of the Veteran's hand
 ;; condition (brief summary): _________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; b. Dominant hand:
 ;; ___ Right   ___ Left   ___ Ambidextrous
 ;;
 ;; 3. Flare-ups
 ;; Does the Veteran report that flare-ups impact the function of the hand?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, document the Veteran's description of the impact of flare-ups in
 ;; his or her own words: ______________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 4. Initial range of motion (ROM) measurements
 ;; Measure ROM with a goniometer, rounding each measurement to the nearest 5
 ;; degrees. During the measurements, document the point at which painful
 ;; motion begins, evidenced by visible behavior such as facial expression,
 ;; wincing, etc. Report initial measurements below.
 ;;
 ;; Following the initial assessment of ROM, perform repetitive use testing.
 ;; For VA purposes, repetitive use testing must be included in all joint exams.
 ;; The VA has determined that 3 repetitions of ROM (at a minimum) can serve as
 ;; a representative test of the effect of repetitive use. After the initial
 ;; measurement, reassess ROM after 3 repetitions. Report post-test measurements
 ;; in section 5.
 ;; 
 ;; a. Is there limitation of motion or evidence of painful motion for any
 ;; fingers or thumbs?
