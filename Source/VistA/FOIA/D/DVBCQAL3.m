 ;;

 ;;
 ;; f. Does the Veteran need frequent assistance for adjustment of any special
 ;; prosthetic or orthopedic appliance(s)?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, describe: __________________________________________________________
 ;;^TOF^
 ;; NOTE: For VA purposes, "bedridden" will be that condition which actually
 ;; requires that the claimant remain in bed. The fact that claimant has
 ;; voluntarily taken to bed or that a physician has prescribed rest in bed for
 ;; the greater or lesser part of the day to promote convalescence or cure will
 ;; not suffice.
 ;;
 ;; g. Is the Veteran bedridden?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;     If yes, is it due to the Veteran's ALS?
 ;;     ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; h. Does the Veteran require care and/or assistance on a regular basis due to
 ;; his or her physical and/or mental disabilities in order to protect him or
 ;; herself from the hazards and/or dangers incident to his or her daily
 ;; environment?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;    If yes, is it due to the Veteran's ALS?
 ;;     ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; i.  List any condition(s), in addition to the Veteran's ALS, that causes any
 ;; of the above limitations: __________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 9. Need for higher level (i.e., more skilled) Aid & Attendance (A&A)
 ;;
 ;; Does the Veteran require a higher, more skilled level of A&A?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; NOTE: For VA purposes, this skilled, higher level care includes (but is not
 ;; limited to) health-care services such as physical therapy, administration of
 ;; injections, placement of indwelling catheters, changing of sterile
 ;; dressings, and/or like functions which require professional health-care
 ;; training or the regular supervision of a trained health-care professional to
 ;; perform. In the absence of this higher level of care provided in the home,
 ;; the Veteran would require hospitalization, nursing home care, or other
 ;; residential institutional care.
 ;;^TOF^
 ;; 10. Assistive devices
 ;;
 ;; a. Does the Veteran use any assistive device(s) as a normal mode of
 ;; locomotion, although occasional locomotion by other methods may be possible?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, identify assistive device(s) used (check all that apply and indicate
 ;; frequency):
 ;;
 ;;   ___ Wheelchair  Frequency of use: __ Occasional   __ Regular   __ Constant
 ;;   ___ Brace(s)    Frequency of use: __ Occasional   __ Regular   __ Constant
 ;;   ___ Crutch(es)  Frequency of use: __ Occasional   __ Regular   __ Constant
 ;;   ___ Cane(s)     Frequency of use: __ Occasional   __ Regular   __ Constant
 ;;   ___ Walker      Frequency of use: __ Occasional   __ Regular   __ Constant
 ;;   ___ Other: _______________________________________________________________
 ;;                   Frequency of use: __ Occasional   __ Regular   __ Constant
 ;;
 ;; b. If the Veteran uses any assistive devices, specify the condition and
 ;; identify the assistive device used for each condition: _____________________
 ;;
 ;; ____________________________________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 11. Remaining effective function of the extremities
 ;;
 ;; Due to ALS condition, is there functional impairment of an extremity such
 ;; that no effective function remains other than that which would be equally
 ;; well served by an amputation with prosthesis? (Functions of the upper
 ;; extremity include grasping, manipulation, etc., while functions for the
 ;; lower extremity include balance and propulsion, etc.)
 ;;
 ;; ___ Yes, functioning is so diminished that amputation with prosthesis would
 ;;     equally serve the Veteran.
 ;; ___ No
 ;;     If yes, indicate extremity(ies)(check all extremities for which this
 ;;     applies):
 ;;     ___ Right upper   ___ Left upper   ___ Right lower   ___ Left lower
 ;;
 ;;     For each checked extremity, describe loss of effective function,
 ;;     identify the condition causing loss of function, and provide specific
 ;;     examples (brief summary): ______________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 12. Financial responsibility
 ;;
 ;; In your judgment, is the Veteran able to manage his/her benefit payments in
 ;; his/her own best interest, or able to direct someone else to do so?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If no, provide rationale: __________________________________________________
 ;;^TOF^
 ;; 13. Diagnostic testing
 ;;
 ;; NOTE: If pulmonary function testing (PFT) is indicated due to respiratory
 ;; disability, and results are in the medical record and reflect the Veteran's
 ;; current respiratory function, repeat testing is not required. DLCO and
 ;; bronchodilator testing is not indicated for a restrictive respiratory
 ;; disability such as that caused by muscle weakness due to ALS.
 ;;
 ;; a. Have PFTs been performed?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, provide most recent results, if available:
 ;;
 ;; FEV-1: ____________ % predicted   Date of test: _____________
 ;; FVC:  _____________ % predicted   Date of test: _____________
 ;; FEV-1/FVC: ________ % predicted   Date of test: _____________
 ;;
 ;; b. If PFTs have been performed, is the flow-volume loop compatible with
 ;; upper airway obstruction?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; c. Are there any other significant diagnostic test findings and/or results?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, provide type of test or procedure, date and results (brief summary):
 ;;
 ;; ____________________________________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 14. Functional impact
 ;;
 ;; Does the Veteran's ALS impact his or her ability to work?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, describe the impact of the Veteran's ALS, providing one or more
 ;; examples: __________________________________________________________________
