 ;;E. Diagnosis:
 ;;
 ;;      1.  State whether or not the veteran has diabetes mellitus.  Indicate
 ;;          type.
 ;;      2.  List all conditions found that are potentially complications of
 ;;          diabetes, such as visual impairment, kidney disease, neurologic
 ;;          disease, amputation, cardiovascular disease (including hypertension),
 ;;          etc.
 ;;      3.  For each listed condition that is potentially a complication of the
 ;;          veteran's diabetes, state whether or not you believe it is a
 ;;          complication and provide a brief rationale for your conclusion,
 ;;          whether positive or negative.  Your rationale may include such items
 ;;          as the duration of the diabetes, whether the diabetes has been well
 ;;          or poorly controlled, the onset of the possible complication in
 ;;          relation to the onset of diabetes, the severity of the complication,
 ;;          or anything else you consider relevant.
 ;;      4.  If the veteran has peripheral edema, indicate the etiology (for
 ;;          example, diabetic renal disease, other diabetic-related condition,
 ;;          or non-diabetic etiology).
 ;;      5.  If the veteran has a non-service-connected condition that in your
 ;;          opinion has been aggravated by the veteran's diabetes (including any
 ;;          of the conditions you listed above or any other claimed), describe
 ;;          your rationale for stating that there is aggravation.  Then state
 ;;          the baseline disabling effects of the condition before aggravation
 ;;          and any additional or worsened disabling effects after aggravation.
 ;;          If it is not possible to do so without resorting to speculation, so
 ;;          state.
 ;;      6.  For each condition diagnosed (including diabetes and each
 ;;          complication), separately describe its effect on the veteran's usual
 ;;          occupation and daily activities.
