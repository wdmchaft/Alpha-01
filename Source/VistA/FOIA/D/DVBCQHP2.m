 ;; Your patient is applying to the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for
 ;; disability benefits.  VA will consider the information you provide on this
 ;; questionnaire as part of their evaluation in processing the Veteran's claim.
 ;;
 ;; 1. Diagnosis
 ;; Does the Veteran now have or has he/she ever had a hip and/or thigh condition?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, provide only diagnoses that pertain to hip/thigh conditions:
 ;; Diagnosis #1: _____________________
 ;; ICD code:  ____________________
 ;; Date of diagnosis: ________________
 ;; Side affected: ____ Right   ____ Left   ____ Both
 ;;
 ;; Diagnosis #2: ___________________
 ;; ICD code:  ______________________
 ;; Date of diagnosis: ______________
 ;; Side affected: ____ Right   ____ Left   ____ Both
 ;;
 ;; Diagnosis #3: ___________________
 ;; ICD code:  ______________________
 ;; Date of diagnosis: ______________
 ;; Side affected: ____ Right   ____ Left   ____ Both
 ;;
 ;; If there are additional diagnoses pertaining to hip/thigh conditions, list
 ;; using above format:_________________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 2. Medical history
 ;; Describe the history (including onset and course) of the Veteran's current
 ;; hip/thigh condition(s) (brief summary):_____________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 3. Flare-ups
 ;; Does the Veteran report that flare-ups impact the function of the hip
 ;; and/or thigh?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, document the Veteran's description of the impact of flare-ups in
 ;; his or her own words: ______________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 4. Initial range of motion (ROM) measurements
 ;; Measure ROM with a goniometer, rounding each measurement to the nearest
 ;; 5 degrees. During the measurements, document the point at which painful
 ;; motion begins, evidenced by visible behavior such as facial expression,
 ;; wincing, etc. Report initial measurements below.
 ;;
 ;; Following the initial assessment of ROM, perform repetitive use testing.
 ;; For VA purposes, repetitive use testing must be included in all joint
 ;; exams. The VA has determined that 3 repetitions of ROM (at a minimum)
 ;; can serve as a representative test of the effect of repetitive use. After
 ;; the initial measurement, reassess ROM after 3 repetitions. Report
 ;; post-test measurements in section 5.
