 ;; 5. Severity
 ;;
 ;; NOTE: Based on symptoms and findings from Sections 3 and 4, complete items
 ;; a and b below to provide an evaluation of the severity of the Veteran's
 ;; diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
 ;;
 ;; NOTE: For VA purposes, the term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree
 ;; of lost or impaired function substantially less than the description of
 ;; complete paralysis that is given with each nerve.
 ;;
 ;; If the nerve is completely paralyzed, check the box for "complete paralysis."
 ;; If the nerve is not completely paralyzed, check the box for "incomplete 
 ;; paralysis" and indicate severity.  For VA purposes, when nerve impairment is
 ;; wholly sensory, the evaluation should be mild, or at most, moderate.
 ;;
 ;; a. Does the Veteran have an upper extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, indicate nerve affected, severity and side affected:
 ;;
 ;;    Radial nerve (musculospiral nerve) 
 ;;    Note: Complete paralysis(hand and fingers drop, wrist and fingers flexed;
 ;;          cannot extend hand at wrist, extend proximal phalanges of fingers,
 ;;          extend thumb or make lateral movement of wrist; supination of hand,
 ;;          elbow extension and flexion weak, hand grip impaired)
 ;;
 ;;       ___ Right:
 ;;           ___ Normal   ___Incomplete paralysis   ___ Complete paralysis

 ;;
 ;;       ___ Left:
 ;;           ___ Normal   ___ Incomplete paralysis  ___ Complete paralysis
 ;;           If incomplete paralysis is checked, indicate severity:
 ;;               ___ Mild   ___ Moderate   ___ Severe 
 ;;
 ;;    Median nerve
 ;;    Note:  Complete paralysis (hand inclined to the ulnar side, index and
 ;;           middle fingers extended, atrophy of thenar eminence, cannot
 ;;           make fist, defective opposition of thumb, cannot flex distal
 ;;           phalanx of thumb; wrist flexion weak)
 ;;
 ;;       ___ Right:
 ;;           ___ Normal   ___ Incomplete paralysis  ___ Complete paralysis

 ;;^TOF^
 ;;       ___ Left:
 ;;           ___ Normal   ___ Incomplete paralysis  ___ Complete paralysis
 ;;           If incomplete paralysis is checked, indicate severity:
 ;;               ___ Mild   ___ Moderate   ___ Severe
 ;;
 ;;    Ulnar nerve
 ;;    Note:  Complete paralysis ("griffin claw" deformity, atrophy in dorsal
 ;;           interspaces, thenar and hypothenar eminences; cannot extend ring
 ;;           and little finger, cannot spread fingers, cannot adduct the
 ;;           thumb; wrist flexion weakened).
 ;;
 ;;       ___ Right:
 ;;           ___ Normal   ___ Incomplete paralysis  ___ Complete paralysis
 ;;           If incomplete paralysis is checked, indicate severity:
 ;;               ___ Mild   ___ Moderate   ___ Severe
 ;;
 ;;       ___ Left:
 ;;           ___ Normal   ___ Incomplete paralysis  ___ Complete paralysis
 ;;           If incomplete paralysis is checked, indicate severity:
 ;;               ___ Mild   ___ Moderate   ___ Severe
 ;;
 ;; b. Does the Veteran have a lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;;  If yes, indicate nerve affected, severity and side affected:
 ;;
 ;;  Sciatic nerve
 ;;  Note: Complete paralysis (foot dangles and drops, no active movement of
 ;;        muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or lost).
 ;;
 ;;       ___ Right:
 ;;           ___ Normal   ___ Incomplete paralysis  ___ Complete paralysis
 ;;           If incomplete paralysis is checked, indicate severity:
 ;;               ___ Mild   ___ Moderate   ___ Moderately severe
 ;;               ___ Severe, with marked muscular atrophy
 ;;
 ;;       ___ Left:
 ;;           ___ Normal   ___ Incomplete paralysis  ___ Complete paralysis
 ;;           If incomplete paralysis is checked, indicate severity:
 ;;               ___ Mild   ___ Moderate   ___ Moderately severe
 ;;               ___ Severe, with marked muscular atrophy
 ;;^TOF^
 ;;   ___ Femoral nerve (anterior crural)
 ;;       Note: Complete paralysis (paralysis of quadriceps extensor muscles).
 ;;
 ;;       ___ Right:
 ;;           ___ Normal   ___ Incomplete paralysis  ___ Complete paralysis
 ;;               ___ Mild   ___ Moderate   ___ Severe
 ;;
 ;;       ___ Left:
 ;;           ___ Normal   ___ Incomplete paralysis  ___ Complete paralysis

 ;; 6. Other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs
 ;; and/or symptoms
 ;;
 ;; a. Does the Veteran have any scars (surgical or otherwise) related to any
 ;; conditions or to the treatment of any conditions listed in the Diagnosis
 ;; section above?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, are any of the scars painful and/or unstable, or is the total area
 ;; of all related scars greater than 39 square cm (6 square inches)?
 ;;    ___ Yes   ___ No

 ;;
 ;; b. Does the Veteran have any other pertinent physical findings,
 ;; complications, conditions, signs and/or symptoms related to any conditions
 ;;  listed in the Diagnosis section above?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, describe (brief summary): __________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 7. Diagnostic testing
 ;;
 ;; For purpose of this examination, electromyography (EMG) studies are rarely
 ;; required to diagnose diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The diagnosis of
 ;; diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be made in the appropriate clinical
 ;; setting by a history of characteristic pain and/or sensory changes in a
 ;; stocking/glove distribution and objective clinical findings, which may
 ;; include symmetrical lost/decreased reflexes, decreased strength,
 ;; lost/decreased sensation for cold, vibration and/or position sense, and/or
 ;; lost/decreased sensation to monofilament testing.

 ;;       Right upper extremity  Results:  __ Normal  __ Abnormal   Date: ______
 ;;       Left upper extremity   Results:  __ Normal  __ Abnormal   Date: ______
 ;;       Right lower extremity  Results:  __ Normal  __ Abnormal   Date: ______
 ;;       Left lower extremity   Results:  __ Normal  __ Abnormal   Date: ______
 ;;
 ;; If abnormal, describe: _____________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; b. If there are other significant findings or diagnostic test results,
 ;; provide dates and describe: ________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 8. Functional impact
 ;;
 ;; Does the Veteran's diabetic peripheral neuropathy impact his or her ability
 ;; to work?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, describe impact of the Veteran's diabetic peripheral neuropathy,
 ;; providing one or more examples: ____________________________________________
