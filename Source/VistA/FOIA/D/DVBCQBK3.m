 ;; 11. Straight leg raising test
 ;;
 ;; (This test can be performed with the Veteran seated or supine. Raise each
 ;; straightened leg until pain begins, typically at 30-70 degrees of elevation.
 ;; The test is positive if the pain radiates below the knee, not merely in the
 ;; back or hamstrings. Pain is often increased on dorsiflexion of the foot,
 ;; and relieved by knee flexion. A positive test suggests radiculopathy, often
 ;; due to disc herniation).

 ;; If there are neurological abnormalities other than radiculopathy, also
 ;; complete appropriate Questionnaire for each condition identified.
 ;;
 ;; 14. Intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) and incapacitating episodes

 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; b. If yes, has the Veteran had any incapacitating episodes over the past 12
 ;; months due to IVDS?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; NOTE: For VA purposes, an incapacitating episode is a period of acute
 ;; symptoms severe enough to require prescribed bed rest and treatment by a
 ;; physician.
 ;;
 ;; If yes, provide the total duration  of all incapacitating episodes over the
 ;; past 12 months:
 ;;   ___ Less than 1 week
 ;;   ___ At least 1 week but less than 2 weeks
 ;;   ___ At least 2 weeks but less than 4 weeks
 ;;   ___ At least 4 weeks but less than 6 weeks
 ;;   ___ At least 6 weeks
 ;;^TOF^
 ;; 15. Assistive devices
 ;;
 ;; a. Does the Veteran use any assistive device(s) as a normal mode of
 ;; locomotion, although occasional locomotion by other methods may be possible?

 ;; If yes, identify assistive device(s) used (check all that apply and
 ;; indicate frequency):
 ;;   ___ Wheelchair
 ;;       Frequency of use:   ___ Occasional   ___ Regular   ___ Constant
 ;;   ___ Brace(s)
 ;;       Frequency of use:   ___ Occasional   ___ Regular   ___ Constant
 ;;   ___ Crutch(es)
 ;;       Frequency of use:   ___ Occasional   ___ Regular   ___ Constant

 ;;   ___ Other: _______________________________________________________________
 ;;       Frequency of use:   ___ Occasional   ___ Regular   ___ Constant
 ;;
 ;; b. If the Veteran uses any assistive devices, specify the condition and
 ;; identify the assistive device used for each condition: _____________________
 ;; ____________________________________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 16. Remaining effective function of the extremities
 ;;
 ;; Due to a thoracolumbar spine (back) condition, is there functional
 ;; impairment of an extremity such that no effective function remains other
 ;; than that which would be equally well served by an amputation with
 ;; prosthesis? (Functions of the upper extremity include grasping,
 ;; manipulation, etc.; functions of the lower extremity include balance and
 ;; propulsion, etc.)
 ;;
 ;; ___ Yes, functioning is so diminished that amputation with prosthesis would
 ;;     equally serve the Veteran.
 ;; ___ No
 ;;     If yes, indicate extremity(ies) (check all extremities for which this
 ;;     applies):
 ;;     ___ Right lower   ___ Left lower

 ;;
 ;; b. Does the Veteran have any other pertinent physical findings,
 ;; complications, conditions, signs or symptoms?

 ;; If yes, describe (brief summary)____________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 18. Diagnostic testing
 ;;
 ;; The diagnosis of arthritis must be confirmed by imaging studies. Once
 ;; arthritis has been documented, no further imaging studies are required by
 ;; VA, even if arthritis has worsened.
 ;;
 ;; Imaging studies are not required to make the diagnosis of IVDS;
 ;; Electromyography (EMG) studies are rarely required to diagnose radiculopathy
 ;; in the appropriate clinical setting.
 ;;
 ;; For purposes of this examination, the diagnosis of IVDS and/or radiculopathy
 ;; can be made by a history of characteristic radiating pain and/or sensory
 ;; changes in the legs, and objective clinical findings, which may include the
 ;; asymmetrical loss or decrease of reflexes, decreased strength and/or
 ;; abnormal sensation.
 ;;
 ;; a. Have imaging studies of the thoracolumbar spine been performed and are
 ;; the results available?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, is arthritis documented?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; b. Does the Veteran have a vertebral fracture?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, provide percent of loss of vertebral body: ____________
 ;;^TOF^
 ;; c. Are there any other significant diagnostic test findings and/or results?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, provide type of test or procedure, date and results (brief summary):
 ;; ____________________________________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 19. Functional impact
 ;;
 ;; Does the Veteran's thoracolumbar spine (back) condition impact his or her
 ;; ability to work?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes describe the impact of each of the Veteran's thoracolumbar spine
 ;; (back) conditions providing one or more examples ___________________________
