 ;;
 ;; Your patient is applying to the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
 ;; for disability benefits.  VA will consider the information you provide on
 ;; this questionnaire as part of their evaluation in processing the Veteran's
 ;; claim.  This report is not for treatment purposes; it is to provide a
 ;; summary of medical information for disability claims resolution.
 ;;
 ;; NOTE: This examination must be conducted by a licensed ophthalmologist or
 ;; by a licensed optometrist. The examiner must identify the disease, injury
 ;; or other pathologic process responsible for any decrease in visual acuity
 ;; or other visual impairment found.
 ;;
 ;; Examinations of visual fields or muscle function should be conducted ONLY
 ;; when there is a medical indication of disease or injury that may be
 ;; associated with visual field defect or impaired muscle function.
 ;;
 ;; Unless medically contraindicated, the fundus must be examined with the
 ;; Veteran's pupils dilated.
 ;;
 ;; SECTION I: DIAGNOSES
 ;;
 ;; NOTE: The diagnosis section should be filled out AFTER the clinician has
 ;; completed the examination
 ;;
 ;; Does the Veteran now have or has he/she ever been diagnosed with an eye
 ;; condition (other than congenital or developmental errors of refraction)?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, provide only diagnoses that pertain to eye conditions:
 ;;
 ;; Diagnosis #1: ___________________
 ;; ICD code(s):  ___________________
 ;; Date of diagnosis: ______________
 ;;
 ;; Diagnosis #2: ___________________
 ;; ICD code(s):  ___________________
 ;; Date of diagnosis: ______________
 ;;
 ;; Diagnosis #3: ___________________
 ;; ICD code(s):  ___________________
 ;; Date of diagnosis: ______________
 ;;
 ;; If there are additional diagnoses that pertain to eye conditions, list using
 ;; above format: ______________________________________________________________
 ;;^TOF^
 ;; SECTION II: MEDICAL HISTORY
 ;;
 ;; Describe the history (including onset and course) of the Veteran's current
 ;; eye condition(s) (brief summary):
 ;;
 ;; ____________________________________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; SECTION III: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
 ;;
 ;; 1. Visual acuity
 ;;
 ;; Visual acuity should be reported according to the lines on the Snellen chart
 ;; or its equivalent. If assessment of the Veteran's visual acuity falls
 ;; between two lines on the Snellen chart, round up to the higher (worse) level
 ;; (poorer vision) for answers a-d below. (For example, 20/60 would be reported
 ;; as 20/70; 20/80 would be reported as 20/100, etc.)
 ;;
 ;; Examination of visual acuity must include central uncorrected and corrected
 ;; visual acuity for distance and near vision. Evaluate central visual acuity
 ;; on the basis of corrected distance vision with central fixation. Visual
 ;; acuity should not be determined with eccentric fixation or viewing.

 ;;
 ;; d. Corrected near:
 ;;    Right: __5/200    __10/200    __15/200   __20/200   __20/100   __20/70
 ;;           __20/50    __20/40 or better
 ;;    Left:  __5/200    __10/200    __15/200   __20/200   __20/100   __20/70
 ;;           __20/50    __20/40 or better
 ;;^TOF^
 ;; 2. Difference in corrected visual acuity for distance and near vision
 ;;
 ;; Does the Veteran have a difference equal to two or more lines on the Snellen
 ;; test type chart or its equivalent between distance and near corrected
