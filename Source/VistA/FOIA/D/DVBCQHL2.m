 ;; Your patient is applying to the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for
 ;; disability benefits.  VA will consider the information you provide on this 
 ;; questionnaire as part of their evaluation in processing the Veteran's claim.
 ;;
 ;; NOTE: This form is only for use by VHA staff or contract examiners. 
 ;;
 ;; This exam is for:
 ;;    ___ Tinnitus only (audiologist or non-audiologist clinician)
 ;;           If this exam is for tinnitus only, complete section 2 only.
 ;;           Otherwise complete entire form.
 ;;    ___ Hearing loss and/or tinnitus (audiologist, performing current exam)
 ;;    ___ Hearing loss and/or tinnitus (audiologist or non-audiologist clinician,
 ;;        using audiology report of record that represents Veteran's current
 ;;        condition)
 ;;           If using audiology report of record, date audiology exam was
 ;;           performed: ______________
 ;;
 ;;                        SECTION 1:  HEARING LOSS (HL)
 ;;
 ;; Note: All testing must be conducted in accordance with the following
 ;; instructions to be valid for VA disability evaluation purposes.
 ;;
 ;; Instructions: An examination of hearing impairment must be conducted by a
 ;; state-licensed audiologist and must include a controlled speech discrimination
 ;; test (specifically, the Maryland CNC recording) and a puretone audiometry
 ;; test in a sound isolated booth that meets American National Standards
 ;; Institute standards (ANSI S3.1.1999 [R2004]) for ambient noise. Measurements
 ;; will be reported at the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz.
 ;;
 ;; The examination will include the following tests: Puretone audiometry by
 ;; air conduction at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000 Hz and 8000 Hz,
 ;; and by bone conduction at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz, spondee
 ;; thresholds, speech discrimination using the recorded Maryland CNC Test,
 ;; tympanometry and acoustic reflex tests (ipsilateral and contralateral), and,
 ;; when necessary, Stenger tests.  Bone conduction thresholds are measured when
 ;; the air conduction thresholds are poorer than 15 dB HL.  A modified Hughson-
 ;; Westlake procedure will be used with appropriate masking.  A Stenger must
 ;; be administered whenever puretone air conduction thresholds at 500, 1000,
 ;; 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz differ by 20 dB or more between the two ears.
 ;;
 ;; Maximum speech discrimination will be reported with the 50 word VA approved
 ;; recording of the Maryland CNC test.  The starting presentation level will be
 ;; 40 dB re SRT.  If necessary, the starting level will be adjusted upward to
 ;; obtain a level at least 5 dB above the threshold at 2000 Hz, if not above
 ;; the patient's tolerance level.
 ;;
 ;; The examination will be conducted without the use of hearing aids.  Both
 ;; ears must be examined for hearing impairment even if hearing loss in only
 ;; one ear is at issue.
 ;;
 ;; When speech discrimination is 92% or less, a performance intensity function
 ;; must be obtained.
 ;;
 ;; A comprehensive audiological evaluation should include evaluation results
 ;; for puretone thresholds by air and bone conduction (500-8000 Hz), speech
 ;; reception thresholds (SRT), speech discrimination scores, and acoustic
 ;; immittance with acoustic reflexes (ipsilateral and contralateral reflexes).
 ;; Tests for non-organicity must be performed when indicated.
 ;;
 ;; 1. Objective Findings:
 ;; a. Puretone thresholds in decibels (air conduction):
 ;;
 ;; Instructions: Measure and record puretone threshold values in decibels at the
 ;; indicated frequencies (air conduction).  Report the decibel value, which ranges
 ;; from -10 dB to 105 dB,  for each of the frequencies. Add a plus behind the
 ;; decibel value when a maximum value has been reached with a failure of response
 ;; from the Veteran. In those circumstances where the average includes a failure
 ;; of response at either the maximum allowable limit (105 dB) or the maximum
 ;; limits of the audiometer, use this maximum decibel value of the failure of 
 ;; response in the puretone threshold average calculation.
 ;;
 ;; If the Veteran could not be tested (CNT), enter CNT and state the reason why 
 ;; the Veteran could not be tested.  Clearly inaccurate, invalid or unreliable
 ;; test results should not be reported.
 ;;
 ;; The puretone threshold at 500 Hz is not used in calculating the puretone
 ;; threshold average for evaluation purposes but is used in determining whether
 ;; or not for VA purposes, hearing impairment reaches the level of a disability.
 ;; The puretone threshold average requires the decibel levels of each of the 
 ;; required frequencies (1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, 3000 Hz, and 4000 Hz) be recorded
 ;; for the test to be valid for determination of a hearing impairment.

 ;;
 ;; b. Were there one or more frequency(ies) that could not be tested?
 ;;    ___ Yes  ___ No
 ;; If yes, enter CNT in the box for frequency(ies) that could not be tested, and

 ;;
 ;; d. Speech Discrimination Score (Maryland CNC word list)
 ;;    Instructions on pausing:  Examiners should pause when necessary during
 ;;    speech discrimination tests, in order to give the Veteran sufficient time
 ;;    to respond. This will ensure that the test results are based on actual
 ;;    hearing loss rather than on the effects of other problems that might slow
 ;;    a Veteran's response. There are a variety of problems that might require
 ;;    pausing, for example, the presence of cognitive impairment.  It is up to
 ;;    the examiner to determine when to use pausing and the length of the pauses.

 ;;    ___ Use of speech discrimination score is appropriate for this Veteran.
 ;;    ___ The use of the speech discrimination score is not appropriate for
 ;;          this Veteran because of language difficulties, cognitive problems,
 ;;          inconsistent speech discrimination scores, etc., that make combined
 ;;          use of puretone average and speech discrimination scores
 ;;          inappropriate.

 ;;
 ;; NOTES: 
 ;; * The Veteran may have hearing loss at a level that is not considered to be
 ;; a disability for VA purposes. This can occur when the auditory thresholds
 ;; are greater than 25 dB at one or more frequencies in the 500-4000 Hz range.
 ;;
 ;; ** The Veteran may have impaired hearing, but it does not meet the criteria
 ;; to be considered a disability for VA purposes. For VA proposes, the
 ;; diagnosis of hearing impairment is based upon testing at frequency ranges 
 ;; of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz. If there is no HL in the 500-4000 Hz
 ;; range, but there is HL above 4000 Hz, check this box.
 ;;
 ;; *** The Veteran may have a significant change in hearing threshold in
 ;; service, but it does not meet the criteria to be considered a disability
 ;; for VA purposes. (A significant change in hearing threshold may indicate
 ;; noise exposure or acoustic trauma.)
 ;;  
 ;; 3. Evidence review
 ;; In order to provide an accurate medical opinion, the Veteran's records 
 ;; should be reviewed, if available.
 ;;
 ;; Was the Veteran's VA claims file reviewed?
 ;;    ___ Yes ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, list any records that were reviewed but were not included in the
 ;; Veteran's VA claims file: ___________________________________________________

 ;; probability or greater) caused by or a result of an event in military service?
 ;;    ___ Yes
 ;;    ___ No
 ;;    Rationale (Provide rationale for either a yes or no answer): _____________
 ;;    __________________________________________________________________________
 ;;    ___ Cannot provide a medical opinion regarding the etiology of the Veteran's
 ;;        hearing loss without resorting to speculation
 ;;    Provide rationale for reason speculation required:  ______________________
 ;; Did hearing loss exist prior to the service?
 ;;    ___ Yes
 ;;    ___ No
 ;;    If yes, was the pre-existing hearing loss aggravated beyond normal
 ;;    progression in military service?
 ;;    Right ear   ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;    Left ear    ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; Provide rationale for both yes or no:  ______________________________________
 ;; _____________________________________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 5. Functional impact of hearing loss
 ;; NOTE: Ask the Veteran to describe in his or her own words the effects of
 ;; disability (i.e. the current complaint of hearing loss on occupational
 ;; functioning and daily activities). Document the Veteran's response without
 ;; opining on the relationship between the functional effects and the level
 ;; of impairment (audiogram) or otherwise characterizing the response. Do not
 ;; use handicap scales.
 ;;
 ;; Does the Veteran's hearing loss impact ordinary conditions of daily life,
 ;; including ability to work?
 ;;    ___ Yes    ___ No
 ;;    If yes, describe impact in the Veteran's own words: ______________________
