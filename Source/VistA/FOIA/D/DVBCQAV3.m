 ;; 1.  Amputations
 ;; Has the Veteran had an amputation of an extremity due to a vascular

 ;; ___ Yes    ___ No
 ;; If yes, also complete Amputations Questionnaire.
 ;;
 ;; 2. Assistive devices
 ;; a. Does the Veteran use any assistive device(s) as a normal mode of
 ;; locomotion, although occasional locomotion by other methods may be possible?
 ;; ___ Yes    ___ No
 ;; If yes, identify assistive device(s) used (check all that apply and indicate
 ;; frequency):
 ;;    __ Wheelchair  Frequency of use:  __ Occasional   __ Regular   __ Constant
 ;;    __ Brace(s)    Frequency of use:  __ Occasional   __ Regular   __ Constant
 ;;    __ Crutch(es)  Frequency of use:  __ Occasional   __ Regular   __ Constant
 ;;    __ Cane(s)     Frequency of use:  __ Occasional   __ Regular   __ Constant
 ;;    __ Walker      Frequency of use:  __ Occasional   __ Regular   __ Constant
 ;;    __ Other: ________________________________________________________________
 ;;                   Frequency of use:  __ Occasional   __ Regular   __ Constant
 ;;
 ;; b. If the Veteran uses any assistive devices, specify the condition and
 ;; identify the assistive device used for each condition: ______________________
 ;;
 ;; 3. Remaining effective function of the extremities
 ;; Due to a vascular condition, is there functional impairment of an extremity
 ;; such that no effective function remains other than that which would be
 ;; equally well served by an amputation with prosthesis? (Functions of the
 ;; upper extremity include grasping, manipulation, etc., while functions for
 ;; the lower extremity include balance and propulsion, etc.)
 ;; ___ Yes, functioning is so diminished that amputation with prosthesis would
 ;; equally serve the Veteran.
 ;; ___ No
 ;;     If yes, indicate extremity(ies) (check all extremities for which
 ;;     this applies):
 ;;     ___ Right upper   ___ Left upper   ___ Right lower    ___ Left lower
 ;;     For each checked extremity, describe loss of effective function,
 ;;     identify the condition causing loss of function, and provide specific
 ;;     examples (brief summary): _______________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 4. Other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs
 ;; and/or symptoms
 ;; a. Does the Veteran have any scars (surgical or otherwise) related to any
 ;; conditions or to the treatment of any conditions listed in the Diagnosis

 ;; If yes, are any of the scars painful and/or unstable, or is the total area
 ;; of all related scars 39 square cm (6 square inches) or greater?

 ;; If yes, provide most recent results:
 ;;    ___ Right ankle/brachial index: ___________   Date: ________________
 ;;    ___ Left ankle/brachial index: ____________   Date: ________________
 ;;
 ;; NOTE: An ankle/brachial index is required for peripheral vascular disease
 ;; or aneurysm of any large artery (other than aorta), arteriosclerosis
 ;; obliterans or thrombo-angiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) if not of
 ;; record, or if there has been an intervening change in the Veteran's
 ;; peripheral vascular condition.
 ;;
 ;; b. Are there any other significant diagnostic test findings and/or results?
 ;; ___ Yes    ___ No
 ;; If yes, provide type of test or procedure, date and results (brief summary):
 ;; _____________________________________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 6. Functional impact
 ;; Does the Veteran's vascular condition(s) impact his or her ability to work?
 ;; ___ Yes    ___ No
 ;; If yes, describe impact of each of the Veteran's vascular condition,
 ;; providing one or more examples: _____________________________________________
 ;; _____________________________________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 7. Remarks, if any: _________________________________________________________
