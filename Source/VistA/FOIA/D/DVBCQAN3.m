 ;;
 ;; a. Does the Veteran use any assistive device(s) as a normal mode of
 ;; locomotion, although occasional locomotion by other methods may be possible?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, identify assistive device(s) used (check all that apply and indicate
 ;; frequency):
 ;;
 ;;   ___ Wheelchair  Frequency of use: __ Occasional   __ Regular   __ Constant
 ;;   ___ Brace(s)    Frequency of use: __ Occasional   __ Regular   __ Constant
 ;;   ___ Crutch(es)  Frequency of use: __ Occasional   __ Regular   __ Constant
 ;;   ___ Cane(s)     Frequency of use: __ Occasional   __ Regular   __ Constant
 ;;   ___ Walker      Frequency of use: __ Occasional   __ Regular   __ Constant
 ;;   ___ Other: _______________________________________________________________
 ;;                   Frequency of use: __ Occasional   __ Regular   __ Constant
 ;;
 ;; b. If the Veteran uses any assistive devices, specify the condition and
 ; identify the assistive device used for each condition: ______________________

 ;; 15. Remaining effective function of the extremities
 ;;
 ;; Due to the Veteran's ankle condition(s), is there functional impairment of
 ;; an extremity such that no effective function remains other than that which
 ;; would be equally well served by an amputation with prosthesis? (Functions
 ;; of the upper extremity include grasping, manipulation, etc., while
 ;; functions for the lower extremity include balance and propulsion, etc.)
 ;; ___ Yes, functioning is so diminished that amputation with prosthesis would
 ;;     equally serve the Veteran.
 ;; ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, indicate extremities for which this applies:
 ;;    ___ Right lower    ___ Left lower
 ;;    For each checked extremity, identify the condition causing loss of
 ;;    function, describe loss of effective function and provide specific
 ;;    examples (brief summary): _______________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 16.  Diagnostic Testing
 ;;
 ;; The diagnosis of degenerative arthritis (osteoarthritis) or traumatic
 ;; arthritis must be confirmed by imaging studies. Once such arthritis has
 ;; been documented, no further imaging studies are required by VA, even if
 ;; arthritis has worsened.
 ;;
 ;; a. Have imaging studies of the ankle been performed and are the results
 ;; available?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, are there abnormal findings?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;    If yes, indicate findings:
 ;;    ___ Degenerative or traumatic arthritis
 ;;        ankle: ___ Right   ___ Left   ___ Both
 ;;    ___ Ankylosis
 ;;        ankle: ___ Right   ___ Left   ___ Both
 ;;    ___ Other.  Describe: ____________________
 ;;        ankle: ___ Right   ___ Left   ___ Both
 ;;
 ;; b. Are there any other significant diagnostic test findings and/or results?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, provide type of test or procedure, date and results (brief summary):
 ;; ____________________________________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 17. Functional impact
 ;;
 ;; Does the Veteran's ankle condition impact his or her ability to work?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, describe the impact of each of the Veteran's ankle conditions
 ;; providing one or more examples: ____________________________________________
 ;;^TOF^
 ;; 18. Remarks, if any: _______________________________________________________

 ;; NOTE: VA may request additional medical information, including additional
 ;; examinations if necessary to complete VA's review of the Veteran's
 ;; application.
