 ;;

 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, describe (brief summary): _________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 15. Remaining effective function of the extremities
 ;;
 ;; Due to the Veteran shoulder and/or arm conditions, is there functional
 ;; impairment of an extremity such that no effective function remains other
 ;; than that which would be equally well served by an amputation with
 ;; prosthesis? (Functions of the upper extremity include grasping,
 ;; manipulation, etc)
 ;; ___Yes, functioning is so diminished that amputation with prosthesis would
 ;; equally serve the Veteran.
 ;; ___ No
 ;;^TOF^
 ;;    If yes, indicate extremity(ies) (check all extremities for which this
 ;;    applies):
 ;;    ___ Right upper    ___ Left upper
 ;; For each checked extremity, describe loss of effective function, identify
 ;; the condition causing loss of function, and provide specific examples
 ;; (brief summary): ___________________________________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 16.  Diagnostic Testing
 ;;
 ;; The diagnosis of degenerative arthritis (osteoarthritis) or traumatic
 ;; arthritis must be confirmed by imaging studies. Once such arthritis has been
