 ;; 13. Intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) and incapacitating episodes
 ;;
 ;; a. Does the Veteran have IVDS of the cervical spine?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; b. If yes, has the Veteran had any incapacitating episodes over the past 12
 ;; months due to IVDS?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; NOTE: For VA purposes, an incapacitating episode is a period of acute
 ;; symptoms severe enough to require prescribed bed rest and treatment by a
 ;; physician.
 ;;
 ;;    If yes, provide the total duration over the past 12 months:
 ;;    ___ Less than 1 week
 ;;    ___ At least 1 week but less than 2 weeks
 ;;    ___ At least 2 weeks but less than 4 weeks
 ;;    ___ At least 4 weeks but less than 6 weeks
 ;;    ___ At least 6 weeks
 ;;
 ;; 14. Assistive devices
 ;;
 ;; a. Does the Veteran use any assistive device(s) as a normal mode of
 ;; locomotion, although occasional locomotion by other methods may be possible?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, identify assistive device(s) used (check all that apply and indicate
 ;; frequency):
 ;;   __ Wheelchair   Frequency of use:   __Occasional    __Regular   __Constant
 ;;   __ Brace(s)     Frequency of use:   __Occasional    __Regular   __Constant
 ;;   __ Crutch(es)   Frequency of use:   __Occasional    __Regular   __Constant
 ;;   __ Cane(s)      Frequency of use:   __Occasional    __Regular   __Constant
 ;;   __ Walker       Frequency of use:   __Occasional    __Regular   __Constant
 ;;   __ Other: ________________________________________________________________
 ;;                   Frequency of use:   __Occasional    __Regular   __Constant
 ;;
 ;; b. If the Veteran uses any assistive devices, specify the condition and
 ;; identify the assistive device used for each condition: _____________________

 ;; 15. Remaining effective function of the extremities
 ;;
 ;; Due to a cervical spine (neck) condition, is there functional impairment
 ;; of an extremity such that no effective function remains other than that
 ;; which would be equally well served by an amputation with prosthesis?
 ;; (Functions of the upper extremity include grasping, manipulation, etc.;
 ;; functions of the lower extremity include balance and propulsion, etc.)
 ;;
 ;; ___ Yes, functioning is so diminished that amputation with prosthesis would
 ;; equally serve the Veteran.
 ;; ___ No
 ;;     If yes, indicate extremity(ies) (check all extremities for which this
 ;;     applies):
 ;;         ___ Right upper   ___ Left upper
 ;;
 ;; 16. Other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs
 ;; and/or symptoms
 ;;
 ;; a. Does the Veteran have any scars (surgical or otherwise) related to any
 ;; conditions or to the treatment of any conditions listed in the Diagnosis
 ;; section above?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;; If yes, are any of the scars painful and/or unstable, or is the total area
 ;; of all related scars greater than 39 square cm (6 square inches)?
 ;;     ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;         If yes, also complete a Scars Questionnaire.
 ;;
 ;; b. Does the Veteran have any other pertinent physical findings,
 ;; complications, conditions, signs or symptoms?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, describe (brief summary): __________________________________________
 ;;^TOF^
 ;; 17. Diagnostic testing
 ;;
 ;; The diagnosis of arthritis must be confirmed by imaging studies. Once
 ;; arthritis has been documented, no further imaging studies are required
 ;; by VA, even if arthritis has worsened.
 ;;
 ;; Imaging studies are not required to make the diagnosis of IVDS;
 ;; Electromyography (EMG) studies are rarely required to diagnose radiculopathy
 ;; in the appropriate clinical setting.
 ;;
 ;; For purposes of this examination, the diagnosis of IVDS and/or radiculopathy
 ;; can be made by a history of characteristic radiating pain and/or sensory
 ;; changes in the arms, and objective clinical findings, which may include the
 ;; asymmetrical loss or decrease of reflexes, decreased strength and/or
 ;; abnormal sensation.
 ;;
 ;; a. Have imaging studies of the cervical spine been performed and are the
 ;; results available?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, is arthritis (degenerative joint disease) documented?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; b. Does the Veteran have a vertebral fracture?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, provide percent of loss of vertebral body: ____________
 ;;
 ;; c. Are there any other significant diagnostic test findings and/or results?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, provide type of test or procedure, date and results (brief summary):
 ;; ____________________________________________________________________________

 ;;^TOF^
 ;; 18. Functional impact
 ;;
 ;; Does the Veteran's cervical spine (neck) condition impact his or her
 ;; ability to work?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, describe the impact of each of the Veteran's cervical spine (neck)
 ;; conditions, providing one or more examples _________________________________
