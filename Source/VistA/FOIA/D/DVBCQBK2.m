 ;; Your patient is applying to the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
 ;; for disability benefits.  VA will consider the information you provide on
 ;; this questionnaire as part of their evaluation in processing the Veteran's
 ;; claim.
 ;;
 ;; 1. Diagnosis
 ;;
 ;; Does the Veteran now have or has he/she ever been diagnosed with a
 ;; thoracolumbar spine (back) condition?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, provide only diagnoses that pertain to thoracolumbar spine (back)
 ;; conditions:
 ;;
 ;;     Diagnosis #1: ____________________
 ;;     ICD code: ________________________
 ;;     Date of diagnosis: _______________
 ;;
 ;;     Diagnosis #2: ____________________
 ;;     ICD code: ________________________
 ;;     Date of diagnosis: _______________
 ;;
 ;;     Diagnosis #3: ____________________
 ;;     ICD code: ________________________
 ;;     Date of diagnosis: _______________
 ;;
 ;; If there are additional diagnoses pertaining to thoracolumbar spine (back)
 ;; conditions, list using above format: _______________________________________
 ;;
 ;; 2. Medical history
 ;;
 ;; Describe the history (including onset and course) of the Veteran's
 ;; thoracolumbar spine (back) condition (brief summary): ______________________
 ;;
 ;; 3. Flare-ups
 ;;
 ;; Does the Veteran report that flare-ups impact the function of the
 ;; thoracolumbar spine (back)?
 ;; ___ Yes   ___ No
 ;;
 ;; If yes, document the Veteran's description of the impact of flare-ups in his

 ;;^TOF^
 ;; 4. Initial range of motion (ROM) measurements:
 ;;
 ;; Measure ROM with a goniometer, rounding each measurement to the nearest 5
 ;; degrees. During the measurements, observe the point at which painful
 ;; motion begins, evidenced by visible behavior such as facial expression,
 ;; wincing, etc.  Report initial measurements below.
 ;;
 ;; Following the initial assessment of ROM, perform repetitive-use testing.
 ;; For VA purposes, repetitive-use testing must be included in all exams. The
 ;; VA has determined that 3 repetitions of ROM (at minimum) can serve as a
 ;; representative test of the effect of repetitive use. After the initial
 ;; measurement, reassess ROM after 3 repetitions. Report post-test measurements
 ;; in section 5.
