The content of this directory was imported from
the FOIA Release of VistA made on August 19 2011.

The routines were exported from the cache.dat file,
into a .ro file.

Then the script in the directory:

            Utilities/Scripts/

named:

     extract_routines_from_ro_file.py

was used to extract every individual routine and
to put it in a separate file.

Given that there are more than 26,000 routines,
the files were archived into 26 directories based
on the first letter of their respective names.
